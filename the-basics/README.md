# About The Basics

## odd.py
- The first line of code _imports_ some preexisting functionality from _Python’s standard library_ which is a large stock of software modules providing lots of prebuilt (and high quality) reusable code.
- We specifically request one submodule from the standard library’s datetime module.
- The datetime submodule provides a mechanism to work out the time.
- - *The standard library* isn’t the only place you’ll find excellent importable modules to use with your code. The *Python community* also supports a thriving collection of [third-party modules](https://pypi.org/)
